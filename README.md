E-daughter is an android application that aims to teach and help users that struggles with using android smartphones.

## Idea
The project was started for my mom that very often had problems with sending pictures or changing size of font on her 
mobile device. I kept explaining and showing to her how to do this. But honestly I'm really lazy person and problem solver, 
so I decided to create **E-daughter** for her. Application that will help her, when I'm not available.

There are a lot of elderly people out there that have problem with using smartphones. It causes problem for them with 
staying in touch with family members. 

## Purpose
Main purpose of this app is to teach users how to use android smartphone. Every action that user would like to do can be
split up into steps. Those steps are presented as separated screens where most crucial parts are highlighted.
For example for **sending image from gallery** steps would be:
* choose image inside your gallery app
* find the **share** icon or share option in option menu
* choose app you want to use

For this example it's also important to show user how does share icon look like, because it's not obvious fore every user.

Additionally, whenever it's possible, app will be not only teaching and showing how to do something, but also will be 
helping to acieve the goal.

## Design
As this app is for users that have problems with using android, design should be clean, simple and readable. I decided to
use relatively big buttons that are much easier to tap for people with some disabilities. Additionaly buttons have more
decriptive labels than usual buttons.

## Features
### Main Screen
Screen where all of help entries are displayed. For now there are only two: *Send image* and *Change orientation*.
